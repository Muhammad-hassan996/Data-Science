# Data Science Course Outline

## Python Programming
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation.
- **Data Structures:** Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, and their operations.
- **Control Structures:** Loops (for, while) and Conditional Statements (if-else).
- **Functions and Modules:** Function definitions, imports, and modules.

## Data Science Libraries
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis, DataFrames, and Series.
- **NumPy:** Numerical computing, arrays, and matrix operations.
- **Matplotlib:** Data visualization basics, plotting graphs.
- **Seaborn:** Statistical data visualization, advanced plotting techniques.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning basics, model training, and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow:** Deep learning, neural networks, and model deployment.

## Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning Algorithms
- **Linear Regression:** Predictive modeling, line fitting.
- **Logistic Regression:** Classification problems, binary outcomes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Instance-based learning, classification, and regression.
- **Decision Tree:** Tree-based models for classification and regression.
- **Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic classification, assumptions of independence.
- **Mean and Variance:** Fundamental concepts in statistical analysis.
### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
- **K-Means Clustering:** Partitioning data into k distinct clusters, centroids, and SSE.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Creating a hierarchy of clusters, dendrograms, agglomerative and divisive methods.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** Clustering based on density, identifying noise points.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and visualization of high-dimensional data.
- **Association Rule Learning:** Market basket analysis, Apriori algorithm, and discovering patterns in data.
